<!-- clicking the link Get Repositories triggers the getRepositories() function
We're triggering the request to list a GitHub user's public repositories
<div id="repositories"> is where the list of repos will be displayed

The variables in the template must match the properties (keys) of each repo object in the repos array of objects,
so this means that a repo object (referred to as this inside the each block helper iteration)
has keys of html_url, name, owner, watchers_count, fork_count and open_issues_count
The owner property of the current repo in the iteration is passed to the call to render authorPartial partial,
so within the <script id="author-partial-template"...>, the variables login and avatar-url
are placeholders for the values corresponding to the login and avatar_url keys of the owner property,
which is a key/value pair of the repo object

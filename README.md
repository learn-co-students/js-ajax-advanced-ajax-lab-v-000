## Introduction

When we use XHR to make dynamic web applications, we often need to
manipulate the DOM in repeatable, reusable chunks, keeping the same
structure but filling it in with new data.

Think about a bookstore. That's a place where you can go to buy books.
Like, physically. Like a grocery store but there's a coffee shop inside
and books instead of food.

Okay. So the basic unit of display in a bookstore is a bay of shelves.
Each bay has a number of shelves that fit a number of books. A certain
number of books are shelved "facing," that is, turned so that we can
see the cover, and the rest are shelved the standard way with the spine
out.

So the bay is the basic presentation unit of books, and it defines how
we see the books. Every bay is the same, it's just the
books that change. So the bay is the structure and the books are the
data.

Similarly, our web pages are built up of chunks of markup (structure),
with values (data). And when we get new data via an XMLHttpRequest, or
XHR, we generally are outputting that new data within an already defined
structure.

Yeah. Let's look at it in action.

## Adding Data from XHR Responses to the DOM

We're going to be using some public functions of the
[Github repositories API][api] to illustrate.

Let's create a simple request to list our own public repositories.
First, we need a way to trigger the request and display the data. Let's
add this to our `index.html`.

```html
<body>
  <main id="main">
    <a href="#" onclick="getRepositories()">Get Repositories</a>
    <div id="repositories"></div>
  </main>
  <script src="handlebars.js"></script>
  <script src="index.js"></script>
</body>
```

In our link, we're firing a `getRepositories` function when a user clicks the
"Get Repositories" anchor tag, so let's implement that in `index.js`.

```js
function getRepositories() {
  const req = new XMLHttpRequest();
  req.addEventListener('load', showRepositories);
  req.open('GET', 'https://api.github.com/users/octocat/repos');
  req.send();
}
```

Here we're initializing a new `XMLHttpRequest()` and making a `GET`
request to the URI for the list user repositories API.

We're also defining a callback function, `showRepositories`, to handle
the response, so let's jump in to that and output our repositories to
the page.

```js
function showRepositories(event, data) {
  const repos = JSON.parse(this.responseText);
  const repoList = `<ul>${repos
    .map(r => '<li>' + r.name + '</li>')
    .join('')}</ul>`;
  document.getElementById('repositories').innerHTML = repoList;
}
```

We've used `JSON.parse` to parse the response string into proper
objects, and we're simply building an unordered list by using `map` to
create `<li></li>` nodes for each object in `repos`.

This is easy enough, we can get it done in one line, and if we load up
`index.html` in our browser, everything should work.

But let's look again at the [response][response] for our repository list. Each
object has so much information available! Surely we want to display more than
just the name.

Let's add the HTML URL as a link.

```js
function showRepositories(event, data) {
  const repos = JSON.parse(this.responseText);
  const repoList = `<ul>${repos
    .map(r => '<li><a href="' + r.html_url + '">' + r.name + '</a></li>')
    .join('')}</ul>`;
  document.getElementById('repositories').innerHTML = repoList;
}
```

Still manageable, but getting kind of ugly with all that concatenation in there.
If we want to add anything else, surely we'll need to break it up into more
lines.

Let's add the watcher, fork, and issues counts.

```js
function showRepositories(event, data) {
  const repos = JSON.parse(this.responseText);
  const repoList =
    '<ul>' +
    repos
      .map(r => {
        return `
          <li>
            <h2><a href="${r.html_url}">${r.name}</a></h2>
            <p>Watchers: ${r.watchers_count}</p>
            <p>Forks: ${r.forks_count}</p>
            <p>Issues: ${r.open_issues_count}</p>
          </li>`;
      })
      .join('') +
    '</ul>';
  document.getElementById('repositories').innerHTML = repoList;
}
```

Now it's getting a little uglier. And that's with the benefit of interpolation.
If we were concatenating all of these strings, even worse!

We don't want all this HTML code in our JavaScript functions. First, it just
doesn't belong there. Putting a presentation concern inside a function whose
purpose is to parse data is a violation of [SoC][soc] and just bad code
organization.

But more practically, it's just going to get harder and harder to edit and keep
track of this HTML as long as we have to wrap it in this JavaScript function.
We'll inevitably need to change it, add styling, add more fields, and every time
we'll be running the risk of misplacing that little backtick or introducing some
other bug.

It's as if every box of books also came with the wood and shelves to build a new
bay, and we had to construct it by hand every single time.

We need a way to have a pre-fabricated bay of shelves ready to go and
receive a new stack of books. We need a _template_.

## Handlebars Templates

[Handlebars][handlebars] is a template engine that gives us a way to build HTML
templates separately from our code and allow us to use those templates to
dynamically update the DOM.

Creating a Handlebars template is simple. We just create the HTML that we want
within a `script` tag, and use the `{{}}` delimiters to hold places for data.
Let's convert our repository template to Handlebars inside `index.html`.

```html
<script id="repository-template" type="text/x-handlebars-template">
  <ul>
   {{#each this}}
     <li>
       <h2><a href="{{html_url}}">{{name}}</a></h2>
       <p>Watchers: {{watchers_count}}</p>
       <p>Forks: {{forks_count}}</p>
       <p>Issues: {{open_issues_count}}</p>
     </li>
    {{/each}}
  </ul>
</script>
```

Keep in mind that the variable names between the double-curly-brace delimiters
should match the names of the properties of the context object, in this case,
our JSON response.

Note that rather than build each list item separately in a loop, we're making
use of the `{{#each}}` helper to build our list for us based on the array of
objects we pass in.

Now let's update our `showRepositories` code to use the template.

```js
function showRepositories(event, data) {
  const repos = JSON.parse(this.responseText);
  const src = document.getElementById('repository-template').innerHTML;
  const template = Handlebars.compile(src);
  const repoList = template(repos);
  document.getElementById('repositories').innerHTML = repoList;
}
```

We get the `innerHTML` of our template `script` tag to compile into a `template`
function that we pass our JSON response into.

Since we are giving the template function the entire collection of repository
objects, adding new fields to our template is as easy as creating the markup.

Let's add the owner information to our template.

```html
<script id="repository-template" type="text/x-handlebars-template">
  <ul>
   {{#each this}}
     <li>
       <h2><a href="{{html_url}}">{{name}}</a></h2>
       <section>
          <header><h4>Created By {{owner.login}}</h4></header>
          <img src="{{owner.avatar_url}}" height="32" width="32">
       </section>
       <p>Watchers: {{watchers_count}}</p>
       <p>Forks: {{forks_count}}</p>
       <p>Issues: {{open_issues_count}}</p>
     </li>
    {{/each}}
  </ul>
</script>
```

If we reload our page, everything works! Handlebars allows us to access the
entire object graph, so `{{owner.login}}` works just fine to access the `login`
property of the `owner` property of the repository and we didn't have to make
any JavaScript edits.

And that's the power of using a template engine like Handlebars. The
presentation, or HTML code, can be managed separately from the logic and data.

Before we end, let's take this one step further. This author section looks like
something we might be able to reuse, say for a list of commits. Let's extract it
into a Handlebars partial.

First, we have to make some edits to our template, and create a new template for
our partial.

```html
<script id="repository-template" type="text/x-handlebars-template">
  <ul>
   {{#each this}}
     <li>
       <h2><a href="{{html_url}}">{{name}}</a></h2>
       {{> authorPartial owner }}
       <p>Watchers: {{watchers_count}}</p>
       <p>Forks: {{forks_count}}</p>
       <p>Issues: {{open_issues_count}}</p>
     </li>
    {{/each}}
  </ul>
</script>
<script id="author-partial-template" type="text/x-handlebars-template">
  <section>
    <header><h4>Created By {{login}}</h4></header>
    <img src="{{avatar_url}}" height="32" width="32">
  </section>
</script>
```

We created a new `script` tag for our partial template, and we're rendering it
within our repository template via the `{{> authorPartial owner}}` line. We're
passing `owner` to the template, which is really `this.owner`, or the `owner`
property of the current repository object since we are inside the `{{#each}}`
block.

To get this to work, we just need to register the partial with Handlebars when
the page loads, so let's add the following to our `index.js`.

```js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function(event) {
  Handlebars.registerPartial(
    'authorPartial',
    document.getElementById('author-partial-template').innerHTML
  );
});
```

This will tell Handlebars to make a partial called `authorPartial` out of the
contents of our partial template.

Now if we reload everything and get those repositories, everything should still
work, and we have nice, modular code to keep future changes as hassle-free as
possible!

## Summary

In this lesson we reviewed getting data via XHR, and using that data to
manipulate the DOM. Then we saw how powerful it is to pair Handlebars templates
with XHR to create dynamic web applications, and how we can use these tools to
adhere to separation of concerns and write modular, well-organized code.[]
